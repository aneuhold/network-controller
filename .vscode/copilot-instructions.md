## Project Structure

This repo is dedicated to the TP-Link Omada SDN Controller. It contains Docker configuration files and scripts to run the controller in a containerized environment. Note that there exists the folder `./5.15.15.20_Source_Scripts` that contains the source scripts for that Omada Controller version. This is not code that is meant to be executed from this project. It is just the source code for the omada controller that is downloaded. This is just to help with debugging and understanding the code.
